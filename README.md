# This is Ski-leaves

http://ski-leaves.herokuapp.com/

Ski-leaves estimates future skiing conditions by examining this week's forecast. If a given location has a high probability of fresh snow, its Ski-Leaves Powder Prediction Index will be higher. The official units of the Index are %inches, but it's easiest to think of it as a unitless number that has not ceiling.

I built Ski-leaves as my project for [Fullstack Academy's "Stackathon"](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/hackathon-presentations) in which students have 4 days to create anything they'd like. To build this, I used:
* React
* Redux
* React-Redux
* [React-Leaflet](https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet)
* Express
* Sequelize
* PostgreSQL

For external APIs, I used:
* [Dark Sky Api](https://darksky.net/dev/) to gather weather information and
* [skimap.org](https://skimap.org/pages/Developers) for the ski resort information.
